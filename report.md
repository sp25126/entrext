## Backend Test Results (Evidence-Based)

| ID | Test | Status | Failure Reason |
|----|------|--------|----------------|
| **SECURITY** | Proxy: SSRF Firewall | ✅ PASS | Blocked localhost, private IPs, and metadata schemes. |
| **SECURITY** | Proxy: Header Stripping | ✅ PASS | Successfully neutralized CSP and X-Frame-Options. |
| **CORE** | Project: Creation (Valid) | ❌ FAIL | 401 Unauthorized (TestClient dependency mock mismatch). |
| **CORE** | Project: URL Validation | ✅ PASS | Successfully rejected invalid schemes in schema. |
| **AI** | Triage: Provider Fallback | ❌ FAIL | LLMUnreachable error not caught in fallback test case. |
| **AI** | Triage: Structured Parsing| ✅ PASS | Successfully handled malformed JSON retries. |
| **WS** | Real-time: Connect/Join | ❌ FAIL | WebSocketDisconnect during protocol handshake. |
| **WS** | Real-time: Rate Limiting | ❌ FAIL | Rate limit logic verified in code, but WS test failed. |
| **EXPORT** | Engine: Markdown Gen | ✅ PASS | Verified sorting (P0 first) and AI metadata. |
| **HEALTH** | System: Diagnostics | ✅ PASS | Latency reporting and connection checks operational. |

## Frontend Test Results (Systematic Audit)

| ID | Test | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| **F-1** | Project Creation Flow | ✅ PASS | Logic verified in `projectStore` and `new/page.tsx`. |
| **F-2** | Share Token Resolution | ✅ PASS | Verified `[shareToken]/page.tsx` data resolution. |
| **F-3** | Real-time Sync (Cursors)| ❌ FAIL | Blocked by WebSocket failure in backend tests. |
| **F-4** | Optimistic Commenting | ✅ PASS | Verified instant UI updates in `commentStore`. |
| **F-5** | IFrame Proxy Display | ✅ PASS | Verified `ProxyService` transformation integrity. |

## Directory Audit Summary
[STATUS] backend/app/main.py — Points of entry and middleware — ✅ ACTIVE (OK)
[STATUS] backend/app/api/routes/health.py — System diagnostics — ✅ ACTIVE (OK)
[STATUS] backend/app/api/routes/proxy.py — Secure proxy rendering — ✅ ACTIVE (OK)
[STATUS] backend/app/core/config.py — System settings — 🔴 SECURITY (Secrets in code)
[STATUS] backend/app/db/client.py — Supabase initialization — 🔴 SECURITY (SSL Bypass Hack)
[STATUS] backend/app/services/llm_router.py — Legacy LLM logic — 🔴 DEAD (Replace/Delete)
[STATUS] web/src/lib/api.ts — Legacy fetcher — 🔴 DEAD (Replace/Delete)
[STATUS] web/src/store/mockStore.ts — Legacy state — 🔴 DEAD (Replace/Delete)
[STATUS] web/src/store/realtimeStore.ts — WS state management — ⚠️ INCOMPLETE (Missing heartbeats)

- Files to DELETE: 3 (`llm_router.py`, `api.ts`, `mockStore.ts`)
- Files to FIX: 3 (`config.py`, `db/client.py`, `realtimeStore.ts`)
- Security issues found: 2 (Hardcoded secrets, SSL Bypass)
- Architecture violations fixed: 2 (Logic in health.py, 'any' types in stores)

## Architecture Violations (Persistent)
- **Direct Supabase Calls**: None (Moved to `queries.py` during audit).
- **TS 'any' Types**: 2 remaining in `CommandCenter.tsx` (complex list refs).
- **Bare except:**: Fixed in `health.py`.
- **Logic in Routes**: Minimal (WS rate limiting remains in `ws.py`).

## Known Issues (Honest)
1. **WebSocket Stability**: The backend WebSocket protocol crashes under `TestClient` simulation. Professional protocol audit required.
2. **Auth Mocking**: Critical `pytest` failures in Project routes (401) suggest the test fixtures are not correctly bypassing `get_db_user`.
3. **AI Fallback**: The Groq -> Gemini fallback failed in 1 specific edge case in `test_ai.py`.

## Required Fixes Before Deployment
1. **P0 (SECURITY)**: Fix SSL verification in `db/client.py`; Remove `verify=False`.
2. **P0 (BLOCKER)**: Resolve WebSocket protocol mismatch to enable collaboration.
3. **P1 (SECURITY)**: Move `JWT_SECRET` and `SUPABASE_KEY` to encrypted secret manager (e.g., Vault or Github Secrets).
4. **P2 (QUALITY)**: Fix `TestClient` auth fixtures to restore 100% test coverage for Projects.

---
**Verdict: NOT PRODUCTION READY.** 
The core 'Indestructible API' is architecturally sound, but WebSocket instability and security bypasses must be resolved before enterprise deployment.
